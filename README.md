# Pantheon Migration Plugin - Power Users

Over the past month or so we have been engaged with the folks over at https://blogvault.net working on a great tool for migrating a WordPress from another host directly onto the Pantheon platform.

We are looking for some folks to help us test out the plugin even further at the current stage it's at now. So far we have have successful migrations from WP Engine, Pagely, and several other hosts.

## What we are looking for

Users that have WordPress sites on other hosts that can test the migration process from their to Pantheon and submit any type of errors, bugs, or files to exclude so we can add them to the blacklist which the BlogVault engine uses to weed out specific files while migrating a site to Pantheon.

### Here are a list of hosts that would be great to test from if possible:

- GoDaddy Managed WordPress platform
- BlueHost
- HostGator
- Kinsta
- Web Synthesis
- SiteGround
- FlyWheel
- Any Digital Ocean droplet spinup
- CloudWays
- Where to download the plugin to test

We have setup the plugin in the WordPress.org repo that is available to download and install now on the production/test server to migrate to Pantheon.

### How to post issues/bugs to their specific host here

https://github.com/atjuch/pantheon-migration/issues

Label your issue titles with the name of the host in them, example:

#### `[GoDaddy] Getting error when migrating`

We will be reviewing these daily and marking their status as appropriate

### Have a successful migration and want to share about it?
